# Dart Integration Rules

This document outlines the rules and conventions for integrating with the Dart task management system for this project.

## Core Principles

- **Single Source of Truth:** Dart is the single source of truth for all project tasks, bugs, features, and sprints.
- **Task-Branch-Commit:** Every significant piece of work should be associated with a Dart task. Git branches and commits should reference the corresponding Dart Task ID.

## Workflow

1.  **Task Creation:**
    - New tasks, features, or bugs will be identified and discussed.
    - Before starting work, a corresponding task should be created in Dart using the `create_task` tool.
    - Tasks should be assigned to the appropriate `dartboard`, typically **"General/Tasks"**.
    - The task `title` should be clear and concise.
    - The `description` should include a detailed explanation of the task, acceptance criteria, and any relevant context.
    - The appropriate `type` (e.g., "Task", "Bug", "Feature") and `priority` should be set.
    - Relevant `tags` from the available list should be applied to categorize the work (e.g., "UI", "Backend", "Bug").

2.  **Working on a Task:**
    - When starting a task, a new git branch should be created. The branch name should follow the convention: `[type]/[TASK_ID]-[short-description]`. For example: `feature/TASK-123-add-video-upload`.
    - The task in Dart should be moved to the **"Doing"** status.
    - All commits related to the task should reference the task ID in the commit message (e.g., `feat(video): Add compression to upload flow (TASK-123)`).

3.  **Completing a Task:**
    - Once the work is complete and tested, the corresponding Dart task should be updated using the `update_task` tool.
    - The task status should be moved to **"Done"**.
    - A comment may be added to the task using `add_task_comment` with a summary of the changes and a link to the pull request if applicable.
